<p>emergeVWM is  Emerge Desktop's &quot;Virtual Window Manager&quot; applet. It allows the user to switch monitor views between different virtual &quot;desktops&quot;, and displays a grid of corresponding mini-windows   in a movable and resizeable window.</p>
<table bgcolor="#7f907f" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" width="100%">

    <font color="white"><b>Configuration</b></font>   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>emergeVWM is configured by pressing the Ctrl key and right-clicking on the emergeVWM window. This opens the configuration menu:</p>
<p><img src="ConfigMenu.png" width="157" height="118"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>About</strong> displays the module's author and version and the current scheme's path and filename.<br>
    <strong>Load Scheme</strong> allows the user to browse and select a <a href="Schemes.html">Scheme File</a>.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Reload Current Scheme</strong> allows to reload the current scheme after editing.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>Configure</strong> displays the emergeLauncher configuration dialog box.<br>
  <strong>Exit</strong> closes the module. It can be restarted by highlighting it and clicking on the Start <img src="Start.png" width="24" height="23"> button in the Launch Applet dialog box (see <a href="emergeCore.htm">emergeCore</a>).</p>
<p>After selecting <strong>Configure</strong>, the configuration dialog box opens. The first tab is <strong>General</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="VWMConfig1.png" width="446" height="459"></p>
<p><strong>SnapMove</strong> makes the window snap to the edges of other applets' windows or the edges of the screen when moving it.</p>
<p><strong>SnapSize</strong> makes the window snap to the edges of other applets' windows or the edges of the screen when changing its size.</p>
<p><strong>Click Through</strong> allows clicking &quot;through&quot; the window (i.e. allows clicking on whatever is behind it).</p>
<p><strong>Click Through</strong> has two modes: <strong>Full</strong> (the whole window is &quot;transparent&quot; to mouse input), or <strong>Background</strong> (only the background area is &quot;transparent&quot; but the user can click on the icons in emergeTray, emergeTasks, emergeLauncher, the text in emergeCommand, emergePower, the active mini-window in emergeVWM, the graphs in emergeSysMon). </p>
<p><u>Important notes</u>: 1) <strong>Full Click Through </strong>works for any level of opacity, from opaque to fully transparent; 2) <strong>Background Click Through </strong>automatically sets the background to transparent but does not change the scheme, this is a known limitation; 3) To manipulate an applet set on <strong>Full Click Through, </strong>the user must press the Shift key: Shift+Ctrl+LeftClick to move the applet, Shift+Ctrl+RightClick to get the configuration menu and Shift+Alt to resize the applet.</p>
<p>The number of Virtual <strong>Desktops</strong> (or Windows) is defined by the number of <strong>Rows</strong> and <strong>Columns</strong> defined. The total number of virtual desktops is given by the number of rows times the number of columns (e.g. if the user sets both to 3, she will have 9 Virtual Desktops)</p>
<p>The configuration dialog box's second tab is <strong>Sticky Items</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="VWMConfig2.png" width="446" height="459"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Sticky Applications </strong>are programs which have been set to be displayed in each Virtual Desktop.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">Note that in the VWM window, they show only on the active one. </p>
<p><strong>Hide Sticky Applications </strong>hides the items in the <strong>Sticky Applications</strong> window from view in the VWM window, as the user may not find necessary to see these always-present items in the VWM window. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">To Add <img src="Add.png" width="24" height="23"> a new <strong>Sticky Application</strong>, the user Browses&nbsp;to an <strong>Application</strong> file <img src="BrowseFile.png" width="26" height="25" style="width: 24px; height: 23px;"> , or just types in that window the name of the executable (e.g. Calc for the Calculator). </p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">The user then clicks on Save <img src="Save.png" width="24" height="23" style="width: 24px; height: 23px;"> (or Discard <img src="Discard.png" width="24" height="23" style="width: 24px; height: 23px;"> to start over). Pressing the <strong>OK</strong> button saves the current settings and closes the configuration dialog box.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Sticky Applications </strong>can be deleted <img src="Delete.png" width="24" height="23" style="width: 24px; height: 23px;"> after hightlighting them. </p>
<p class="style3" style="margin-top: 0;">After the user adds, deletes or modifies incorrectly an item, she can undo changes by clicking the <strong>Cancel</strong> button. A dialog box opens asking for confirmation to close the configuration dialog box without saving the changes made.</p>
<p>The configuration  dialog box's third tab is <strong>Position</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="VWMConfig3.png" width="446" height="459"></p>
<p><strong>Anchor Point</strong> gives the choice of anchoring the window to the monitor's <strong>Top Left, Top Center, Top Right, Middle Left, Middle Center, Middle Right, Bottom Left, Bottom Center, or Bottom Right</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>ZPosition</strong> defines the relative position of the window in the Z axis (i.e. from the screen to the user) and can be set to always on the <strong>Top</strong>, <strong>Normal</strong> (behaves as a regular program window), or always at the <strong>Bottom</strong>.</p>
<p>Note that for multi-monitor setups, each emergeVWM desktop shows all the monitors in each mini window.</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Left-clicking on a &quot;desktop&quot; (i.e. Virtual Window) in the VWM window will switch the monitor view to that desktop. </p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">Selecting a task from emergeTasks or via Alt-Tab switches to the desktop where the task resides, restores the task (if minimized), and moves the window to the foreground. </p>
<p>Moving an application between desktops can be done by left-clicking it in the VWM window and dragging it to the desired desktop.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the user can set hotkeys or type in the emergeCommand window to move from one desktop to an other. The <a href="internal.htm">Internal Commands</a> available for this purpose are: VWM_1, VWM_2, VWM_3, VWM_4, VWM_5, VWM_6, VWM_7, VWM_8, VWM_9, VWMLeft, VWMRight, VWMUp and VWMDown. </p>
<p>The user can also gather all currently running tasks on the active desktop by executing the command VWMGather.</p>
<p>An other way to have an application reside on a specific desktop is to start it while on that desktop.</p>
<p>Double left clicking on the VWM window opens up the Display Properties dialog box.</p>

<p>To move the window, the user must press the Ctrl key, left-click on the window, and drag it to another location. </p>
<p>To resize the window, the user must press the Alt key, left-click on one edge of the window, and drag it to a new size.</p>
<p><span class="style4" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The window position and size are stored in the applet's xml file, which is located  in the User Profile folder under &quot;\Application Data\Emerge Desktop\themes&quot;, in a subfolder with the same name as the current Theme. See <a href="ThemeManager.htm">Theme Manager</a> for more details.</span></p>
