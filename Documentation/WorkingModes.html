Emerge Desktop can be run in 3 distinct modes:</p>
<ul class="style4">

<li><i><b>Installed</b></i> - The location of the executables is selected using the Windows installer. A program group is created in the Start Menu folder and all user files are created in %AppData%\Emerge Desktop\</li><br>

<li><i><b>Not Installed</b></i> - The user unpacks the binaries (exe and dll files) to any folder on any drive. The user needs to run the command "emergeCore.exe&nbsp;/shellchanger" on the folder selected to set Emerge Desktop as shell. No program group is created in the Start Menu folder. All user files are created in %AppData%\Emerge Desktop\</li><br>

<li><i><b>Portable</b></i> - The user unpacks the binaries (exe and dll files) to any folder on any drive. The user needs to run the command "emergeCore.exe&nbsp;/shellchanger" on the folder selected to set Emerge Desktop as shell. No program group is created in the Start Menu folder. All user files are created in %AppData%\Emerge Desktop\. By moving all the files (in particular theme.xml) in %AppData%\Emerge Desktop\ to the folder containing the binaries, Emerge Desktop becomes a fully portable shell which can be run even from an external drive or USB pen</li>
</ul>

(<b>Warning for portable mode:</b> if the drive letter for the external drive changes you could become temporarily shell-less. This is only for advanced users!)
