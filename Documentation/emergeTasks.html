<p>emergeTasks is the 'Tasks' applet for Emerge Desktop. It displays an icon for each running task in a movable,  resizeable window.</p>
<table bgcolor="#7f907f" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" width="100%">

      <td> <font color="white"><b>Configuration</b></font> </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>emergeTasks is configured by pressing the Ctrl key and right-clicking on the emergeTasks window. This opens the configuration menu:</p>

<p><img src="AboutCommandH.png" width="147" height="119"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>About</strong> displays the module's version, the current style's path and filename and author.<br>
    <strong>Load Style</strong> allows the user to browse and select a <a href="Styles.html">Style File</a>.<br>
    <strong>Reload Current Style</strong> allows to reload the current style after editing.<br>
    <strong>Configure</strong> displays the emergeCommand configuration dialog box.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>Exit</strong> closes the module. It can be restarted by highlighting it and clicking on the Start <img src="Start.png" width="24" height="23"> button in the Launch Applet dialog box (see <a href="emergeCore.html">emergeCore</a>).</p>
<p>After selecting <strong>Configure</strong>, the configuration dialog box opens. The first tab is <strong>General</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="TaskConfig1.png" width="446" height="459"></p>
<p><strong>SnapMove</strong> makes the window snap to the edges of other applets' windows or the edges of the screen when moving it.</p>

<p><strong>SnapSize</strong> makes the window snap to the edges of other applets' windows or the edges of the screen when changing its size.</p>
<p><strong>AutoSize</strong> keeps the window to a minimum size around the icons. A number may be entered after <strong>wrap at</strong> to specify the amount of icons per row or column (depending on <strong>Orientation</strong> in <strong>Position</strong> tab). The size of the window can no longer be changed by dragging an edge while pressing the Alt key.</p>
<p><strong>Highlight Active Task</strong> sets the background of the active program's icon with the &quot;Selected&quot; opacity and color in the <a href="Styles.html">Style Editor</a> tab.</p>
<p><strong>Click Through</strong> allows clicking &quot;through&quot; the window (i.e. allows clicking on whatever is behind it). It has two modes: <strong>Full</strong> (the whole window is &quot;transparent&quot; to mouse input), or <strong>Background</strong> (only the background area is &quot;transparent&quot; but the user can click on the icons in emergeTray, emergeTasks, emergeLauncher, the text in emergeCommand, emergePower, the active mini-window in emergeVWM, the graphs in emergeSysMon). </p>
<p><u>Important notes</u>: 1) <strong>Full Click Through </strong>works for any level of opacity, from opaque to fully transparent; 2) <strong>Background Click Through </strong>automatically sets the background to transparent but does not change the style, this is a known limitation; 3) To manipulate an applet set on <strong>Full Click Through, </strong>the user must press the Shift key: Shift+Ctrl+LeftClick to move the applet, Shift+Ctrl+RightClick to get the configuration menu and Shift+Alt to resize the applet.</p>
<p><strong>Icon Size</strong> gives the choice of 16x16, 32x32 or 48x48 pixel icons. Due to system limitations, 48x48 pixel icons can not be used under Windows 2000.</p>
<p><strong>Icon Spacing</strong> defines the spacing in pixels between adjacent icons.</p>
<p><strong>Flash</strong> / <strong>Enable</strong> allows a task icon to flash when the task calls for the user's attention. The <strong>Interval</strong> between flashes must be set (in milliseconds), and the <strong>Count</strong> sets the amount of flashes. 0 Count = non-stop flashing.</p>

<p>The configuration dialog box's second tab is <strong>Position</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="TaskConfig2.png" width="446" height="459"></p>
<p><strong>Anchor Point</strong> gives the choice of anchoring the window to the monitor's <strong>Top Left, Top Center, Top Right, Middle Left, Middle Center, Middle Right, Bottom Left, Bottom Center, or Bottom Right</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>ZPosition</strong> defines the relative position of the window in the Z axis (i.e. from the screen to the user) and can be set to always on the <strong>Top</strong>, <strong>Normal</strong> (behaves as a regular program window), or always at the <strong>Bottom</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Orientation</strong> defines if the icons are set as a column (<strong>Vertical</strong>) or as a row (<strong>Horizontal</strong>). </p>
<p>Independently of the the Orientation, the icons can have three options for <strong>Horizontal </strong>or <strong>Vertical Alignment</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Horizontal Aligment</strong> can be set to: align on the <strong>Left</strong> of the applet (i.e. new items are added to the right), <strong>Center</strong> (i.e. expand in both directions in relation to the horizontal center), or on the <strong>Right</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Vertical Aligment </strong>can be set to: <strong>Top</strong> of the applet, vertical <strong>Center</strong>, or <strong>Bottom</strong>.</p>
<p>If <strong>Autosize</strong> is not selected, when icons reach an edge, they will add a new row  or column to the window, depending on <strong>Vertical</strong> or <strong>Horizontal</strong> <strong>Orientation</strong>.</p>
<p>For the configuration dialog box's third tab, see the <a href="Styles.html">Style Editor</a>.</p>

<p>Left-clicking on a task icon restores its program window (if minimized), and move the window to the foreground. </p>
<p>Right-clicking on a task icon displays its system menu.</p>
<p>Left-clicking on the active program's task icon minimizes its window.</p>
<p>Double-clicking on the window starts the Windows Task Manager.</p>
<p>To move the window, the user must press the Ctrl key, left-click on the window, and drag it to another location. </p>
<p>To move the position of an icon, the user must press the Alt key, left-click on the icon, and drag it to an other location within the window.&nbsp; </p>
<p>To resize the window (provided that <strong>Autosize</strong> is not selected), the user must press the Alt key, left-click on one edge of the window, and drag it to a new size.</p>
<p>The window position and size are stored in the applet's xml file, which is located  in the User Profile folder under &quot;\Application Data\Emerge Desktop\themes&quot;, in a subfolder with the same name as the current Theme. See <a href="ThemeManager.html">Theme Manager</a> for more details.</p>
