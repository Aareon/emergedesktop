<p>
emergeTray is the 'system tray' applet of Emerge Desktop. It displays the system icons in a resizeable / movable box.
</p>
<table bgcolor="#7f907f" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
    <tr>
      <td> <font color="white"><b>Configuration</b></font> </td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>emergeTray is configured by holding down 'Ctrl' while right clicking on the tray window (by default appears as a grey square located on the top left corner of the screen showing the icons that appear on the left side of the clock in the Explorer taskbar). This will display the
configuration menu</p>

<img alt="" src="ConfigMenu.png">

<p>The About option displays the module's author and version and the current scheme's path and filename.<br>
Load Scheme allows the user to browse and select a <a href="Schemes.html">Scheme File</a>.<br>
Edit Current Scheme displays the <a href="Schemes.html">Emerge Desktop Scheme Editor</a>.<br>
Reload Current Scheme allows to reload the current scheme after editing.<br>
The Exit option closes the module. It can be restarted by running the executable file emergeTray.exe.</p>

<p>The Configure option displays the emergeTray Configuration dialog box</p>

<img alt="" src="ConfigTray.png">

<p>SnapMove toggles if the window should snap to the edge of other applets or the edges of the screen when moving.</p>

<p>SnapSize toggles if the window should snap to the edge of other applets or the edges of the screen when sizing.</p>

<p>Autosize toggles if the window should automatically adjust it's size to the number of icons present. If unselected then the user should set the size (see Usage below).</p>

<p>Dynamic Positioning toggles if the window should automatically change it's position when the desktop resolution changes.</p>

<p>Icon Spacing defines the spacing in pixels between adjacent icons</p>

<p>Show Icons on Hover toggles if the Hidden Icons are displayed when the cursor is over the tray.</p>

<p>Click Through toggles if the user can click through the applets. If Click Through is activated, the user can choose between two modes: Full (the whole applet is &quot;transparent&quot; to mouse input) or Background (only the background area is &quot;transparent&quot; but the user can click on the icons in emergeTray, emergeTasks, emergeLauncher, the text in emergeCommand and the miniature windows in emergeVWM). <b>Important notes</b>: 1) Full Click Through works for any level of opacity, from opaque to fully transparent; 2) Background Click Through automatically sets the background to transparent but does not change the scheme, this is a known limitation; 3) To manipulate an applet set to Full Click Through the user must press the Shift key: Shift+Control+LeftClick to move the applet, Shift+Control+RightClick to get the Config menu and Shift+Alt to resize the applet.</p>

<p>ZPosition defines the relative position of the window in the Z-axis i.e. from the screen to the user and can be set to Always on Top, Always on Bottom or Normal (behaves as a regular program window).</p>

<p>Orientation defines if the icons are set as a column (Vertical) or as a row (Horizontal). Independently of the the Orientation, the icons can have three options for Horizontal or Vertical Alignment. Horizontal Aligment can be set to: align to the Left of the applet (i.e. new tray items are added to the right), Center (i.e. expand in both directions in relation to the horizontal center) or to the Right. Vertical Aligment can be set to: Top of the applet, vertical Center or Bottom.</p>

<p>If emergeTray is not set to Autosize, when icons reach an edge they will grow (i.e. start a new row  or column) according to the Horizontal and Vertical Alignments selected. Wrapping for the Center option is the same as for Top or Left, i.e. new lines are added under or the the right of a full column or row,</p>

<p>Hidden Icons is a list of the icons which the user selected to remain hidden.</p>

<p>To Add <img style="width: 24px; height: 23px;" alt="" src="Add.png"> a new hidden tray item, the user just needs to type the text (or part of it) showed in the tooltip for that icon (i.e. the text in the yellow box that shows when the cursor is over the tray icon). The user should then click on Save <img style="width: 24px; height: 23px;" alt="" src="Save.png"> or Clear <img style="width: 24px; height: 23px;" alt="" src="Clear.png"> to start again.</p>
<p>The Hidden Icons items displayed in the list box can be Deleted <img style="width: 24px; height: 23px;" alt="" src="Delete.png"> by selecting the item from the list. If at any time the user adds or deletes any Hidden Icon, he can undo changes by pressing the Cancel button. This will close the Configure box without saving any modifications since the dialog was opened. Pressing the OK button will save the current settings and close the configuration dialog</p>

<p><b>Important Note:</b> Items can be added at  any time (if the emergeTray dialog is closed) to the Hidden Icons list by pressing Alt while left clicking on the item to be hidden</p>

<p>Clicking on a tray icon will perform the action defined by the icon of that specific click. For example, left clicking on the Volume icon will bring up the volume slider. Double left clicking on the Volume icon displays the sound control window. Right clicking on the Volume icon displays a menu.</p>

<p>Left clicking on the edge of the window while holding down the 'Alt' key will allow for resizing the window. Simply drag the mouse, and the window will resize itself accordingly. The new size of the window is stored in the Width and Height settings in the registry, so it's new size will be remembered on the next start of emergeTray.</p>

<p>Holding down 'Ctrl' while left clicking on the window will allow it to be dragged around the desktop. When the window nears the screen edge, it will snap to it, also, it will not allow itself to be dragged off screen. Similar to the resizing, the new position is stored in the X and Y settings in the registry so that they will be remembered on next start.</p>
