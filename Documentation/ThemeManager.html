<p>The Theme Manager is a component of <a href="emergeCore.html">emergeCore</a>. It allows to save, and switch between, sets of different emerge Desktop settings.</p>
<table bgcolor="#7f907f" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
    <tr>
      <td>
          <font color="white"><b>Configuration</b></font>
      </td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>The Theme Manager is accessed by right-clicking on the desktop, clicking on <strong>Settings</strong>, and <strong>Theme Manager</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="Settings.png" width="166" height="159"><br></p>
<p>After selecting <strong>Theme Manager</strong>, the <strong>Theme Manager </strong>dialog box opens:</p>
<p><img src="ThemeManager.png" width="432" height="113"></p>
<p>To switch to a different Theme, the user clicks on the arrow <img src="Arrow.png" width="19" height="21"> , selects a <strong>Theme</strong> and clicks the <strong>OK</strong> button.</p>
<p>Themes save:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>the applets loaded (in Launch Applets dialog box),<br />
  the Desktop borders, menu opacity, etc. (all settings in emergeDesktop General tab),<br />
  the Styles of each applet (set in each applet's Style Editor tab),<br />
  the location and size of each loaded applet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above is saved in xml files in the User Profile folder under &quot;\Application Data\Emerge Desktop\themes\&quot;,  in a subfolder with the name of the Theme.</p>
<p>They don't save:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>the RightClick and MiddleClick Desktop menus (set in emergeDesktop Menu Editor tab),<br />
  the aliases,<br />
  the emergeCommand history,<br />
  the shells added by the user,<br />
  the hotkeys,<br />
  the hidden icons in emergeTray,<br />
  the sticky items in emergeVWM.</p>
</blockquote>

When opening the Theme Manager, a reminder that the current Theme has been changed is that the name is followed by &quot;<strong>(modified)</strong>&quot;, and  then, if opening an other Theme, the user will be prompted to save the current one before the new one is opened.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">A Theme can be Deleted <img style="width: 24px; height: 23px;" alt="" src="Delete.png"> after highlighting it. Pressing the <strong>OK</strong> or the <strong>Cancel </strong>button closes the dialog box.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">An emerge Desktop Theme can be exported as a zip file by clicking on Export <img src="Export.png" width="24" height="23"> , and a Theme can be imported to emerge Desktop (also in zip file format) by clicking on Import&nbsp;<img src="Import.png" width="24" height="23"> .</p>
<p>Themes are saved in folders which are located  in the User Profile folder under &quot;\Application Data\Emerge Desktop\themes&quot; (see also <a href="Directory.html">Directory Structure)</a></p>
